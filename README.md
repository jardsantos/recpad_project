## **The Mesothelioma's Cancer**:

The Mesotheliona is a rare type of cancer that affects the mesothelium. The mesohtelium is the tissue that lines your lungs, stomach, heart, and other organs. It usually starts in the lungs, but can also start in the abdomen or other organs. It can be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer.)

Malignant mesothelioma is a rare but serious type of cancer. This cances is usually assigned to people that work on jobs that exposed them to asbestos particles. After being exposed to asbestos, it usually takes a long time for the disease to form.

The asbestor particles become lodged in the pleura, a serous membrane which folds back onto itself to form a two-layered membranous pleural sac over the lungs. Over time, the asbestos fibers cause inflammation, scarring and eventually lead to mesothelioma cancer.

## **Database source**:	
This study uses the patient’s medical reports generated by Dicle University. The dataset contains 34 attributes, one binary response variable and 324 instances. The response variable is disposed in the following distribution:

| Values  | # |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1  | 220 |
| 2  | 104 |

In the first phase of our model we partitioned the data into training and testing dataset, each one with 75% and 25% of the original data set, we applied the stratify option in order to maintain the balancing of the original dataset.
